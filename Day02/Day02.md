### After attending the keynote

Before the AMD keynote, I watched You Tube videos like Steve Jobs or Tim Cook's Apple keynote.
So this is the first keynote to attend.
But, it was very different from You Tube.
It was a very good experience for me. I felt real technology and passion of the attendees.
Also I really respected the presenter.
From my point of view, I felt she was proficient in English. And I was deeply impressed that she was proud of her company. (AMD products)
Thanks to these keynote, I got a bucket list in my life. 
If I become the team leader in the future, I'd like to feel the joy of explaining our team's technology and products proudly in front of a large audience. like I watched it.
