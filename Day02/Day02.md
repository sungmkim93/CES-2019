### After attending the keynote

<strong>Before the AMD keynote, I watched You Tube videos like Steve Jobs or Tim Cook's Apple keynote.</br>
So this is the first keynote to attend. </br>
But, it was very different from You Tube.</br>
It was a very good experience for me. I felt real technology and passion of the attendees.</br>
Also I really respected the presenter.</br>
From my point of view, I felt she was proficient in English. And I was deeply impressed that she was proud of her company. (AMD products)</br>
Thanks to these keynote, I got a bucket list in my life. </br>
If I become the team leader in the future, I'd like to feel the joy of explaining our team's technology and products proudly in front of a large audience. like I watched it.</br> </strong>
